    "Using 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data gathered from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) placed on the top of the foot of a subject, can we accurately classify their activity (e.g. walking, running, standing, sitting, laying down, etc.)? Further, could refinements be made to integrate the data to model the gait of the subject and analyze their stride length, velocity or other factors?\n",
